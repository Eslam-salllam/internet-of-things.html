	<p>Artificial intelligence will continue to become a bigger thing:- Smart home hubs, thermostats, lighting systems, and even coffee makers collect data on your habits and patterns of usage. When you set up voice-controlled devices, you allow them to record what you say to them and store those recordings in the cloud. In most cases, the data is collected to help facilitate what is called machine learning.</p>
	<p>Routers will become more Secure to block unwanted access:- The IOD makes your home smarter and more efficient when it secured from cybercriminals. Your home devices are connected with the internet like smart TV, security cameras, door locks and more can add a level of luxury and comfort in your life, but also they can make your home unsafe. Here the router will play an important role by securing the entry point of the internet into your home. While your smart IOT device cannot be protected, the router will protect the entry point of the internet by password production, firewalls, and configure them to allow the only certain device on your network.</p>
	<p>5G arrival will also open the door to new privacy and security concerns :- In time, more 5G IoT devices will connect directly to the 5G network than via a Wi-Fi router. This trend will make those devices more vulnerable to direct attack, according to a recent Symantec blog post. For home users, it will become more difficult to monitor all IoT devices, because they will bypass a central router On a broader scale, the increased reliance on cloud-based storage will give attackers new targets to attempt to breach.</p>
	<p>Cars will get even smarter:- The arrival of 5G will shift the auto industry into a higher gear. The development of driverless cars as well as the connected vehicles already on the road  will benefit from data moving faster. You might not think of your car as an Internet of Things device. But new cars will increasingly analyze your data and connect with other IoT devices including other high-tech vehicles on four wheels.</p>
	<p>IoT-based DDoS attacks will take on more dangerous forms:- Botnet-powered distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have used infected IoT devices to bring down websites. IoT devices can be used to direct other attacks, according to a Symantec blog post. For instance, there may be future attempts to weaponize IoT devices. A possible example would be a nation shutting down home thermostats in an enemy state during a harsh winte</p>
