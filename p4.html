</h1>
<p>Smart Homes:- Smart homes are most trendy among these applications. The vision of a smart home is to control home appliances including lights, water flow from taps home security and safety. House owner gets access to control and monitor these actions from their smart devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops). Imagine a situation that you forgot to turn off a water tap, you are already out of your home. You can just turn off from your phone. Smart homes allow you to manage all your home devices from one place. One can also use a security camera under the IoT facility to avoid thefts and robbery</p>

<P>Health Care:- IoT applications can turn reactive medical-based systems into proactive wellness-based systems. The resources that current medical research uses, lack critical real-world information. It mostly uses leftover data, controlled environments, and volunteers for medical examination. IoT opens ways to a sea of valuable data through analysis, real-time field data, and testing. The Internet of Things also improves the current devices in power, precision, and availability. IoT focuses on creating systems rather than just equipment .Here is how an IoT-enabled care device works</P>

<P>-Internet of Nano-Things:- The IoNT is made up of linked Nano devices through current network and telecommunications systems. The IoNT added a fresh aspect to the IoT by incorporating Nano sensors into devices to allow them to interact globally between systems around the globe through the Nano network and the Internet. The IoNT defines how the Internet will grow as Nano sensors connect to physical stuff like physical resources or consumer devices to collect, process and share information with end customers. IoNT has various important applications such as smart agriculture, health care, military, logistics, aerospace, industrial control systems, manufacturing, and smart cities.</P>
