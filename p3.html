  <tr>
    <td>Automation:- Automation leads to uniformity in tasks, quality of service and control of day-to-day tasks without human intervention. Machine-to-machine communication also helps maintain transparency throughout the process. </td>  
    <td> Privacy and Security:-  As many of our everyday appliances, machines and services become connected to the internet, much more information is readily available. It makes it harder to keep confidential information out of the hands of hackers and other unauthorized users. </td>
<tr>
  <td>Efficiency:- Machine-to-machine interaction provides for better efficiency, enabling people to focus on other jobs.</td>
  <td>Compatibility:-Currently, there is not international standard of compatibility for the IoT which can make it hard for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
  <td>Cost Savings:- In addition to the optimal utilization of energy and resources, the IoT helps alleviate the problems associated with bottlenecks, breakdowns and system damages.</td>
  <td>Less Jobs:- As IoT brings in more consistent automation, we could see a decline in the need for unskilled employees in the workplace.</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Communication:-  IoT allows physical devices to stay connected and better communicate, which creates greater quality control</td>
   <td>Technologically Dependent Life:- As our lives become more and more dependent on technology, basic human interaction skills will be reduced across society.</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
   <td>Instant Data Access:- More available information helps simplify the decision making process, making life easier to manage.</td>
